## 🛠️ Advanced Configuration

### Custom ASCII Character Sets

```python
# Define your own character set
CUSTOM_CHARS = ["@", "#", "%", "*", "+", "=", "-", ":", ".", " "]

# Use in conversion
ascii_art = pixels_to_ascii_clean(image, CUSTOM_CHARS, method='balanced')
```

### Processing Parameters

```python
# Fine-tune image preprocessing
processed_image = preprocess_image_optimized(
    image,
    contrast=1.4,      # Contrast enhancement (1.0-2.0)
    brightness=1.05,   # Brightness adjustment (0.8-1.2)
    sharpening=True    # Apply sharpening filter
)
```

### Tribute Animation Customization

```python
# Customize tribute animation parameters
animate_clean_ascii_singer(
    image_path="zubeen_portrait.jpg",
    width=120,         # ASCII width (50-150)
    duration=30,       # Tribute length in seconds
    fps=10,           # Frames per second (5-15)
    effects=['assamese_lights', 'cultural_music', 'traditional_stage']
)
```

## 🎯 Tips for Best Tribute Results

### Creating the Perfect Zubeen Tribute
- ✅ **Use iconic Zubeen photographs** with clear facial features
- ✅ **Concert photos work excellently** for animated tributes
- ✅ **High-contrast images** capture his expressive features better
- ✅ **Close-up portraits** preserve the essence of his iconic look

### Cultural Considerations
- 🎭 **Respect the legend** - Use dignified, respectful images
- 🎵 **Celebrate his artistry** - Focus on performance and musical moments  
- 📸 **Choose iconic poses** - Hat, microphone, or signature expressions
- ❤️ **Honor Assamese culture** - Remember this is cultural preservation

### Terminal Setup
- 🖥️ **Use monospace fonts** (Consolas, Courier New, Monaco)
- 🌓 **Dark terminal background** enhances contrast
- 📏 **Ensure terminal width** is wider than ASCII art width
- 🔤 **Smaller font sizes** allow for larger ASCII art

### Performance Optimization
- ⚡ **Use width=80** for faster processing
- ⚡ **Choose 'simple' method** for quick previews
- ⚡ **Lower FPS** (5-8) for smoother animation on slower systems

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: ASCII art appears stretched or distorted
```bash
# Solution: Adjust terminal font to monospace
# Recommended fonts: Courier New, Consolas, Monaco
```

**Problem**: Animation too fast/slow
```python
# Solution: Adjust FPS in animate_clean_ascii_singer()
animate_clean_ascii_singer(image_path, width=120, duration=20)
# Modify the sleep time: time.sleep(1.0 / desired_fps)
```

**Problem**: Tribute doesn't capture Zubeen Da's essence
```python
# Solution: Try different width and method combinations for portraits
ascii_art = image_to_ascii_clean(
    "zubeen_portrait.jpg", 
    width=120,      # Try 100-140 for the best facial recognition
    method='balanced'  # 'balanced' preserves facial features best
)
```

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

| Image Size | Processing Time | ASCII Width | Memory Usage |
